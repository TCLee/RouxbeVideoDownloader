However, it is much more convenient to be able to download the videos to your device and view them anytime without an Internet connection.\r\n\r\n[Download the app.](http://tclee.github.io/RouxbeVideoDownloader/downloads/RouxbeVideoDownloader.tar.gz)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of Rouxbe Video Downloader App](http://tclee.github.io/RouxbeVideoDownloader/images/Screenshot.png \"Screenshot\")\r\n\r\n#### How to use the app?\r\n1. Copy and paste a URL from rouxbe.com. Example: http://rouxbe.com/cooking-school/lessons/240-eggs-frying-basting-poaching\r\n2. Press `Return/Enter` to add downloads to the queue.\r\n\r\n####Features\r\n* Very easy to get started. Just copy and paste a URL to add downloads to the download queue.\r\n* Downloaded Lesson and Recipe videos are automatically organized into folders. Videos are also renamed to match the correct order of the Lesson's or Recipe's steps.\r\n* Videos are saved in MP4 format, so you can view them on your iOS devices.\r\n* Downloads are resumable even after you quit the app.\r\n* You can limit the number of video downloads that can run concurrently to manage your bandwidth.\r\n\r\n##How to Build and Run\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dt>Build Requirements</dt>\r\n  <dd>Xcode 5, Mac OS X 10.9 SDK, CocoaPods</dd>\r\n  <dt>Runtime Requirements</dt>\r\n  <dd>Mac OS X 10.9 or later</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\n####Step 1: Download and Install CocoaPods\r\nIf you've already installed CocoaPods, you can skip to **Step 2**.  \r\nOtherwise, install CocoaPods by following the quick installation guide at <http://cocoapods.org/>.\r\n\r\n####Step 2: Install Library Dependencies\r\nThis sample app needs to download and install the required libraries before it can be build.
